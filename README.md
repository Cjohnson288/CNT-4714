Enterprise Computing Projects


###Project 1:

Objectives: To practice event-driven programming using Java-based GUIs. To refresh your basic Java skills. Description: Develop a Java program that creates a standalone GUI application (not an applet) that simulates an e-store which allows the user to add items (books) to a shopping cart and once all items are included, total all costs (including tax), produces an invoice, and append a transaction log file.


###Project 2:

Objectives: To practice programming an application with multiple threads of execution and synchronizing their access to necessary shared objects.


###Project 3:

Objectives: To develop a two-tier Java based client-server application interacting with a MySQL database utilizing JDBC for the connectivity. This project is designed to give you some experience using the various features of JDBC and its interaction with a MySQL DB Server environment.

###Project 4:

Objectives: To incorporate many of the techniques youâ€™ve learned so far this semester into a distributed three-tier web-based application which uses servlets running on a Tomcat server to access and maintain a persistent MySQL database using JDBC.
